# 🎭 Stringifyer: The Escape Artist of VS Code

> Because sometimes your code needs to wear a disguise

## 🎪 What is this sorcery?

Meet **Stringifyer** – the extension that takes your perfectly innocent text and wraps it in quotes faster than a used car salesman wraps promises in fine print.

Have you ever looked at a beautiful piece of text and thought, "You know what this needs? Backslashes. Lots and lots of backslashes"? Well, probably not, but that's exactly what this extension does anyway!

## ✨ Features (aka "What does this thing actually do?")

- **Instant String Transformation**: Select any text and watch it magically become a proper string literal
- **Escape Character Mastery**: Automatically escapes quotes, backslashes, and newlines like a professional escape room designer
- **Multi-Selection Support**: Because why escape one thing at a time when you can escape everything at once?
- **Zero Configuration**: Works right out of the box (unlike your last relationship)

### Before Stringifyer

```text
Hello World
This is a new line
And this has "quotes"
```

### After Stringifyer

```text
"Hello World\nThis is a new line\nAnd this has \"quotes\""
```

*It's like magic, but with more backslashes!*

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Select some text (any text, we don't judge)
2. Run the command `Stringifyer: Stringify Selection`
3. Watch in amazement as your text gets properly escaped and quoted
4. Feel the satisfaction of a job well done (or at least, a job done)

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **JavaScript Developers**: Who need to quickly stringify template literals
- **JSON Enthusiasts**: Because everything should be in quotes
- **People Who Love Backslashes**: We see you, regex warriors
- **Anyone Who's Ever Copy-Pasted Text**: And then spent 10 minutes manually escaping it

## 🤔 Why Stringifyer?

Because life's too short to manually escape your strings, and too long to do it wrong. This extension is for developers who believe that:

- Time is precious (especially when debugging)
- Automation beats repetition
- Every string deserves proper escaping
- Backslashes are beautiful (in the right context)
